This project is a front-end clone of the Amazon website, built using HTML5 and CSS3. The aim of this project was to replicate the design and layout of Amazon's homepage, focusing on responsiveness, modern web design techniques, and clean, semantic code. Key features include a fully responsive navigation bar, product grid layout, and a footer section, all styled to closely match the original site. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, particularly in HTML and CSS, and serves as a foundational step towards more complex web development projects.
